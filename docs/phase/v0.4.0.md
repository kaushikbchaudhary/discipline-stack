# v0.4.0 – Universal Execution System

## Goal
Refactor Execution OS to be goal-agnostic so it supports any serious pursuit without income or job-search framing.

## Changes
- Added primary Goal model with goal types and active goal selection.
- Generalized block categories to CoreWork, SupportWork, Learning, Practice, Health, Reflection, Recovery.
- Replaced non-replaceable output language with Goal Artifacts.
- Updated onboarding to collect a primary goal and daily execution capacity.
- Updated plan defaults, import prompt, and validation to use goal-neutral categories.
- Updated dashboards, exports, and timeline language to reflect goal artifacts.
- Added background push notifications for task start times (Web Push + service worker).

## Migration Notes
- Existing Income category mapped to CoreWork.
- Existing Creation category mapped to Practice.
- Daily completion now tracks core/practice completion with field mapping to preserve existing data.

## Follow-ups
- Review any remaining “output” or “income” references in custom content.
- Consider migrating historical artifact records into Goal Artifacts for legacy users.
- Document VAPID keys, cron dispatch, and subscription management in deployment notes.
