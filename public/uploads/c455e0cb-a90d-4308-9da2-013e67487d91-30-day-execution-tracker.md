# 30-Day Execution Tracker (Daily Action Plan)

This tracker removes ambiguity.  
You **do not decide what to do each day** — you execute the checklist.

Use this alongside the **Daily Hour-by-Hour Routine**.

---

## How to Use This Tracker
- Each day has **3 mandatory outputs**
- If all 3 are done → the day is a win
- Do NOT compensate missed days
- Just continue to the next day

---

## DAILY NON-NEGOTIABLES (Every Day)
☐ Income Block completed (3 hrs)  
☐ Non-replaceable output created (doc / notes / diagram)  
☐ Gym + cooking completed  

If these 3 are done → stop.
